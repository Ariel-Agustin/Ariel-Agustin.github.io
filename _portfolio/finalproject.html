This map shows the locations of popular Millennial interests (Coffee, Alcohol, and Bikes) and the median household income in Baltimore City. For the sake of data gathering using OpenStreetMap and OverPass Turbo, Barista locations = Coffee, Bartender locations = Alcohol, and Bike locations = Bikes. I dub this the 3 B's Data for Millennials.
