About Me
======
I was born on January 11, 2001 in the Philippines. I moved to the US when I was 2 months old and lived in Maryland ever since. My current hobbies are pool, anime, and videogames. In my spare time I like to clean because when everything is clean I can truly relax.

Brief Education
======
I graduated from Howard Community College in the Spring of 2022 with an Associates Degree and I graduated from University of Maryland Baltimore County in the Spring of 2024 with a Bachelor's Degree in Geography and Environmental Studies and a Minor in Information Systems. 

Final Project
======
Located in my "Portfolio" page above, are my maps depicting the Median Household Income in Baltimore City with bike, barista, and bar locations. This project was created to show the relationship between the frivoulous spending habits of millennials, that is depicted by social media, to where the locations of the amenities are and if they are targetted to millennials specifically. My findings suggest that the locations of these amenities, while in the income range of millennials, is not specifically targetted to millenials but rather the higher income range of individuals as a whole. The majority of the amenities are in the highest income brackets with little to none in the lower income brackets.
