About Me
======
I was born on January 11, 2001 in the Philippines. I moved to the US when I was 2 months old and lived in Maryland ever since. My current hobbies are pool, anime, and videogames. In my spare time I like to clean because when everything is clean I can truly relax.

Brief Education
======
I graduated from Howard Community College in the Spring of 2022 with an Associates Degree and I graduated from University of Maryland Baltimore County in the Spring of 2024 with a Bachelor's Degree in Geography and Environmental Studies and an Minor in Information Systems.
